# Movie Maniac

Movie Maniac is a trivia game. Starting off you can choose your 
difficulty level. There are a total of 10 questions and each time
it will be a unique experience. The harder the difficulty level, the
higher your score. On each question you will have access to different
resources that will provide you with hints, be careful though, clicking
on too many links will lower your score. The hints will be things such
as (Studio, Actors, Genre, Rating, Synopsis, etc.). When you complete
the quiz you will be able to save your highscore and compete against
yourself to become a true Movie Maniac.
