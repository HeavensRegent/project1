# Big Brain Trivia

Choose your way to do trivia: Do you have all day at work to get through? Set the number of questions to 1000. Want to test your knowledge on different areas? Change the category. Feeling bold? Up the difficulty to hard.
But be warned, this is not for the faint of heart. When you get an answer right, you’ll get a compliment. However, when you get an answer wrong, you’ll get a major insult, and if you can’t take it, you won’t make it to the end.
If you make it to the end, you will be able to review your results and update your knowledge of trivia! And save your highscore
